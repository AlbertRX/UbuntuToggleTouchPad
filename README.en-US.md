## üîß Introduction

This is a lightweight script designed for Ubuntu (and Debian-based distributions). The script automatically detects the touchpad device and toggles it between enabled and disabled states. It's useful for laptop users who want a quick way to control the touchpad.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Automatically detects devices with "Touchpad" in their name ‚Äî no manual device ID lookup required.
- Provides two script variants: a basic version (no notifications) and a notification version (uses `notify-send`).
- Minimal dependencies: only `xinput` (commonly preinstalled). The notification version requires `notify-send` (usually provided by `libnotify-bin`).
- Simple, ready-to-use, and terminal-friendly.
